# Duffing Oscillator and Diffusion Limited Aggregation

## Overview
This project focuses on two main aspects: the Duffing Oscillator and Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA). It explores the chaotic behavior of a pendulum influenced by magnets (Duffing Oscillator) and models the aggregation process of particles in a lattice (DLA).

### Duffing Oscillator
- Investigates the chaotic behavior of a pendulum under magnetic influence.
- Uses the Strange Attractor to measure position and velocity of oscillations.
- Aims to determine the fractal dimension of the Strange Attractor.
### Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA)
- Simulates crystal aggregate growth on a lattice.
- Involves initializing a seed, starting random walkers, and drawing occupied sites.
- Analyzes the fractal dimension of dendritic clusters and their properties.
